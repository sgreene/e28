# A Simple Hangman Game

You are prompted with a hint and a box to enter your guesses. You have a total of 6 wrong guesses possible before the game is over. For each correct guess the word will be filled in. Only alphabetic characters are recognized and case does not matter. A list of already used letters will be displayed in the "Already used section".
The game ends when you either guess the right word or you use up all the wrong guesses (whichever comes first).
